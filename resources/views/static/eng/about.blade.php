            <p class="mb-4 leading-loose text-xl border-l-4 border-teal-300 pl-4">8.1 million people suffer from UTI according to WHO statistics 2017.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-loose text-lg">According to the research we conducted in 5  public schools in Dar es salaam, we found out that girls are the most affected group by UTI disease due to limited, dirty and very poor latrines, lack of access to clean water while at school, and personal hygiene education . This situation makes girls to hold or restrain from using the latrines for whole day and acquire the disease easily.  This has contributed to school absentees, increased school dropouts, poor performance and this puts girls at a high risk of gender based violence since they become dependant on their families or partners and prone to deadly diseases in the future such as cervical cancer and  kidney failure.  </p>
