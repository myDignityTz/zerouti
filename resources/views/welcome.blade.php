                It's a disease that attacks the whole urine system. And this disease is caused by a lack of personal hygiene.
                Studies show older men and women are at higher risk of developing UTI.
                For women it is because their genitalia means the genital area is close to the area of greatest need and their urethra is shorter than that of the male.
                For children to be left with long diapers or long underwear for urine and faeces. """            </p>
